# Blikson Link – Unified Delivery API Gateway

## Overview

Blikson Link is a high-performance API gateway that provides a single, standardized interface for multiple Algerian delivery providers (EcoTrack, Yalidine, Noest, etc.). It acts as a proxy layer that normalizes requests and responses, allowing developers to integrate once and connect with multiple shipping services through a consistent API.

## Key Features

* **Multi-Provider Integration**: Unified API for multiple logistics companies
* **High Performance**: Bun runtime + Hono framework for fast, lightweight request handling
* **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript with Zod runtime validation
* **Error Handling & Observability**: Structured logging (Pino), Sentry monitoring, and request tracing
* **Scalable Architecture**: Modular design for easy addition of new providers
* **Developer Experience**: Auto-generated OpenAPI/Swagger docs with Scalar UI
* **Production Ready**: Dockerized with Fly.io deployment configuration

## Architecture

* **Gateway Layer**: Central entry point for client apps
* **Validation Middleware**: Ensures request correctness and company/action resolution
* **Dynamic Module Loading**: Provider actions loaded at runtime for flexibility
* **Response Normalization**: Standard format across all providers for reliability
* **Monitoring & Security**: Structured logs, error sanitization, strict env validation
