## Overview

I developed a comprehensive e-commerce platform with a focus on streamlining operations through integrated shipping management and automated workflows. The project involved creating a sophisticated database schema with complex relations and implementing third-party shipping provider APIs to centralize all business operations in a single dashboard.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Order Management**: Implemented a robust order tracking system with multiple status stages.
- **Shipping Integration**: Developed direct integrations with shipping providers' APIs, eliminating the need for separate shipping management software.
- **Multi-Address Management**: Created a flexible address management system supporting multiple shipping locations per user with validation.
- **Cart System**: Built a sophisticated shopping cart with real-time inventory management and price calculations.
- **Role-Based Authentication (RBA)**: Implemented a robust RBA system to control user access and permissions.

## Technologies Used

- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database with complex relations and constraints
- **Prisma ORM**: For type-safe database operations
- **RESTful APIs**: For shipping provider integrations
- **TypeScript**: For static type checking and better code maintainability
- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and static site generation

## Technical Challenges

- **Complex Database Relations**: Designed and implemented a sophisticated database schema handling multiple entity relationships and business rules.
- **Shipping Integration**: Successfully integrated shipping providers' APIs into a unified interface.
- **Inventory Management**: Implemented category/product management solution across multiple operations (cart, orders, cancellations).
- **Order Tracking**: Created an order tracking system with multiple status updates and automated notifications.

## Business Solutions

- Reduced operational overhead through shipping provider API integration
- Implemented flexible address management supporting various delivery scenarios
- Increased online presence by providing better SEO strategies.
